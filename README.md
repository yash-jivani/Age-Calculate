# Age Calculator
Take age or year of birth as input from the user. Store the input in one variable. 
And returns total numbers of years, months, weeks, and days.

 My code is handling all these errors like :

- You are not yet born.
- Invalid Birth Dates.
- User input string in date of birth.
 - You can also handle any other errors, if possible!
# How to run the script
- Running the script is really simple! Just open a terminal in the folder where your script is located and run the following command :
```python
python Calculate_Age.py
```
